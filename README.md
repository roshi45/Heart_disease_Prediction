# 🏥 Heart Disease Prediction Model

## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. The model is trained on a dataset containing patient health records and applies classification techniques to estimate risk levels.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/heart-disease/data). It includes crucial features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Exercise Habits
- Alcohol Consumption
- Smoking Status
- Family History of Heart Disease
- Diabetes
- Blood Pressure Levels
- Cholesterol Levels

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## 🚀 Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/roshi45/Heart_disease_Prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd heart-disease-prediction

```

## 🏗️ Model Training
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Convert categorical features into numerical format.
3. Normalize the data using MinMaxScaler.
4. Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest,K-Nearest Neighbors,Support Vector Machine,Naive Bayes,Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting.
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
